# Season-Films-Catalogue
My First DEV JS

This Repo was developed by Saheed Odulaja as a practice exercise while learning JavaScript, so feel free to fork the repo, leave a star and make suggestions.

The code consists of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript codes.

Lazy loading was implemented in the project to boost load time, and conserve data (this means that images only gets called from image file (from a local API) when the image box area is within focus).

Little Bug That Needs Fix:
I implemented JS Iteration on the images within wallpapers section with a loop to reload the page when all images within a category is displayed, but most time the page reloads before the iteration count ends (this usually happens on first iteration session of different groups and normalizes thereafter).
